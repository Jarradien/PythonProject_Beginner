# PythonProject_Beginner
Funny learning project for beginners to finish the OpenClassroom curse "DÃ©marrez votre projet avec Python" before attacking OOP and PEP8.

This is a way  for me to really start to use Github so **if you are just looking for interesting code here, you are lost !** 
Thanks for spending your time in a more usefull way but magic is not in this repository.

The project is about displaying random quotes from San Antonio, said by different famous (for French people) cartoon characters.
Here is a link to the curse : https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/4262331-demarrez-votre-projet-avec-python/4263821-repetez-une-action-grace-aux-boucles
