# PythonProject_Beginner
Funny learning project for beginners just to finish the OpenClassroom curse "DÃ©marrez votre projet avec Python".

This a way  for me to really start to use Github so **if you are just looking for interesting code here, you are lost !** 
Thanks for spending your time in a more usefull way.

The project is about displaying random quotes from San Antonio, said by different famous (for French people) cartoon characters.
